# DisBoards [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gregmcgowan/DisBoards.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gregmcgowan/DisBoards)
This is a project that I have been working on and off for a few years. It was borne out of frustration of using the forums on www.drownedinsound.com on a mobile browser.

The aim of the app is to replicate the functionality of the forum (viewing posts, adding comments etc) with a pleasant material design native expreience.

It additon to that I aim to produce a codebase that is well architectured and contains tests.
